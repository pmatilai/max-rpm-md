# <span id="s1-rpm-build-getting-sources">Getting the Sources</span>

The first thing we need to do in order to build a package for
`cdplayer`, is to obtain the sources. Being avid `cdplayer` fans from
way back, we know that the latest source can be found at GnomoVision's
FTP site, so we go get a copy.

We now have a gzipped **tar** file of `cdplayer` version 1.0 on our
system. After putting a copy in the `SOURCES` directory, we're ready to
tell RPM what to do with it.
