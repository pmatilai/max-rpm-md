Welcome\! This is a book about the Red Hat Package Manager, or RPM
Package Manager, known to its friends as simply RPM. The history of RPM
is inextricably linked to the history of GNU/Linux, so a bit of
GNU/Linux history may be in order. GNU/Linux is a full-featured
implementation of a UNIX-like operating system, and has taken the
computing world by storm.

And for a good reason — When choosing GNU/Linux, an Intel-based personal
computer that had previously been prisoner of the dreaded Windows
hourglass is transformed into a fully multitasking, network capable,
personal *workstation*. All for the cost of the time required to
download, install, and configure the software.

Of course, if you're not the type to tinker with downloaded software,
many companies have created CDROMs containing GNU/Linux and associated
software. The amount of tinkering required with these *distributions*
has varied widely. The phrase "You get what you pay for" is never more
true than in the area of GNU/Linux distributions.

One distribution bears the curious name "Red Hat Linux". Produced by a
company of the same name, this GNU/Linux distribution was different. One
of the key decisions a new Linux user needs to make is which of the many
different parts of the distribution to install on their system. Most
distributions use some sort of menu, making it easy to pick and choose.
Red Hat Linux is no different.

But what *is* different about Red Hat Linux is that the creators of the
distribution wanted their customers to have the the ability to make the
same choices long *after* the installation process was over. Some
commercial UNIX systems have this capability (called "package
management"), and a few GNU/Linux distributors were trying to come up
with something similar, but none had at the time the extensive scope
present in RPM.

Over time, Red Hat Linux has become the most popular distribution
available today. For it to edge out the previous leader (Slackware) in
just two years is amazing. There has to be a reason for this kind of
success, and a good part of the reason is RPM. But until the first
edition of this book, there had been precious little in terms of RPM
documentation. You could say that RPM's ease of use has made detailed
instructions practically unnecessary, and you'd be right.

However, there are always people that want to know more about their
computers, and given the popularity of Red Hat Linux, this alone would
have made a book on RPM worthwhile. But there's more to the story than
that.

There is a truism in the world of Free Software, that goes something
like this: If there's a better solution freely available, use it\! RPM
is no exception to the rule. Put under the terms of the GNU General
Public License (Meaning: RPM cannot be made proprietary by *anyone*, not
even Bill Gates), RPM started to attract the attention of others in the
Linux, Unix, and free software communities.

At present, RPM is used by several commercial software companies
producing Linux applications. They find that RPM makes it easier to get
their products into the hands of their customers. They also find that it
can even make the process of *building* their software easier. (Those of
you that develop software for fun and profit, stick around — the second
half of this book will show you everything you need to know to get your
software "RPM-ized")

People have also ported RPM to several commercial UNIX systems,
including DEC's Digital Unix, IBM's AIX, and Silicon Graphics' IRIX.
Why? The simple answer is that it makes it easier to install, upgrade,
and de-install software. If all these people are using RPM, shouldn't
you?
