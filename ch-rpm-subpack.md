# <span id="ch-rpm-subpack"></span>Chapter 18. Creating Subpackages

In this chapter, we will explore one of RPM's more interesting
capabilities: the capability to create subpackages.

<div class="sect1">

# <span id="s1-rpm-subpack-what-are-they">What Are Subpackages?</span>

Very simply put, a subpackage is one of several package files created
from a single spec file. RPM has the ability to create a main package,
along with one or more subpackages. Subpackages may also be created
without the main package. It's all up to the package builder.
