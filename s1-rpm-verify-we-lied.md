Not really; we just omitted a few details until you've had a chance to
see **rpm -V** in action. Here are the details:

## <span id="s2-rpm-verify-verification-control">RPM Controls What Gets Verified</span>

Depending on the type of file being verified, RPM will not verify every
possible attribute. Here is a table showing the attributes checked for
each of the different file types:

### <span id="s3-rpm-verify-package-builder-control">The Package Builder Can Also Control What Gets Verified</span>

When a package builder creates a new package, they can control what
attributes are to be verified on a file-by-file basis. The reasons for
excluding specific attributes from verification can be quite involved,
but here's an example just to give you the flavor:

When a person logs into a system, there are device files associated with
that user's terminal session. In order for the terminal device (called
`tty`) to function properly, the owner and group of the device must
change to that of the person logging in. Therefore, if RPM were to
verify the package that created the `tty` device files, any ttys that
were in use at the time would fail to verify. However, by using the
**%verify** [<span class="footnote">\[1\]</span>](#FTN.AEN4495)
directive, a package builder can save you from trivial verification
failures.
