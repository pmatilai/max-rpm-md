To summarize, a package management system uses the computer to keep
track of all the various bits and pieces that comprise an application or
an entire operating system. Most package management systems use a
specially formatted file to keep everything together in a single, easily
manageable entity, or package. Additionally, package management systems
tend to provide one or more of the following functions:

  - Installing new packages.

  - Removing old packages.

  - Upgrading from an old package to a new one.

  - Obtaining information about installed packages.

RPM has been designed with Red Hat's past package management experiences
in mind. PM and RPP provided most of these functions with varying
degrees of success. Marc Ewing and Erik Troan have worked hard to make
RPM better than its predecessors in every way. Now it's time to see how
they did, and learn how to use RPM\!
