This book is divided into two major sections. The first section is for
anyone that needs to know how to use RPM on their system. Given the
state of the GNU/Linux arena today, this could mean just about anyone,
including people that are new to GNU/Linux, or even UNIX. So those of
you that think that

<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><pre class="screen"><code>ls -FAl !* | less
        </code></pre></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

is serious magic (or maybe even a typing error), relax â€” we'll explain
everything you'll need to know in the first section.

In the book's second half, we'll be covering all there is to know about
building packages using RPM. Since software engineering on GNU/Linux and
UNIX systems requires in-depth knowledge of the operating system,
available tools, and basic programming concepts, we're going to assume
that the reader has sufficient background in these areas. Feel free to
browse through the second half, but don't hesitate to seek additional
sources of information if you find the going a bit tough.
