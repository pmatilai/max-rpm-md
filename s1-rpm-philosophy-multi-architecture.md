# <span id="s1-rpm-philosophy-multi-architecture">Multi-architecture/operating system Support</span>

It has always been a fact of life for software developers that their
applications may need to be ported to multiple operating systems. It is
also becoming more common that a particular operating system might run
on several different platforms, or architectures.

RPM's ability to support multiple architectures and operating systems
makes it easy to build the same package for many OS/platform
combinations. A package may be configured to build on only one
architecture/OS combination, or on several. The only limitation is the
application's portability.
