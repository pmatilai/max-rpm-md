# <span id="s1-rpm-resources-where-to-talk">Where to Talk About RPM</span>

As much as we've tried to make this book a comprehensive reference for
RPM, there are going to be times when you'll need additional help. The
best way to connect with other that use RPM is to try one of the
following mailing lists.

<div class="sect2">

## <span id="s2-rpm-resources-rpm-list">The `rpm-list` Mailing List</span>

Red Hat maintains a mailing list specifically for RPM. In order to
subscribe to the list, it's necessary to send a mail message to:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><pre class="screen"><code>rpm-list-request@redhat.com

        </code></pre></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

On the message's subject line, place the word **subscribe**. After a
short delay, you should receive an automated response with general
information about the mailing list.

To send messages to the list, address them to:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><pre class="screen"><code>rpm-list@redhat.com

        </code></pre></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

As with other on-line forums, it's advisable to "lurk" for a while
before sending anything to the list. That way, you'll be able to see
what types of questions are acceptable for the list. Let the list's name
be your guide; if the message you want to send doesn't have anything to
do with RPM, you shouldn't send it to `rpm-list`\!

In general, the flavor of `rpm-list` is a bit biased towards RPM's
development, building packages, and issues surrounding the porting of
RPM to other systems. If your question is more along the lines of, How
do I use RPM to install new software? consider reviewing the first half
of this book and lurking on `rpm-list` a while first.

<div class="sect2">

## <span id="s2-rpm-resources-redhat-list">The `redhat-list` Mailing List</span>

The `redhat-list` mailing list is meant to serve as a forum for users of
Red Hat's Linux operating system. If your questions concerns the use of
RPM on Red Hat Linux, then the `redhat-list` is a good place to start.
To subscribe, send a message to:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><pre class="screen"><code>redhat-list-request@redhat.com

        </code></pre></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

On the message's subject line, place the word **subscribe**. After a
short delay, you should receive an automated response with general
information about the mailing list. As with `rpm-list`, it's best to
lurk for a while before posting to the list

To send messages to the list, address them to:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><pre class="screen"><code>redhat-list@redhat.com

        </code></pre></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

</div>

<div class="sect2">

## <span id="s2-rpm-resources-redhat-digest">The `redhat-digest` Mailing List</span>

Some people might find the number of messages on `redhat-list` more than
they can handle. However, there is a digest version of the list
available. Each digest consists of one or more messages sent to
`redhat-list`. The digest is sent out when the collected messages reach
a certain size. Therefore, a digest might have one very long message, or
twenty smaller ones. In either case, you'll have the collected knowledge
of the Red Hat development team and their many customers delivered in
one message.

To subscribe to `redhat-digest`, send a message to:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><pre class="screen"><code>redhat-digest-request@redhat.com

        </code></pre></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

On the message's subject line, place the word **subscribe**. After a
short delay, you should receive an automated response with general
information about the mailing list.

To send messages to the list, address them to:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><pre class="screen"><code>redhat-list@redhat.com

        </code></pre></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

As always, observe proper "netiquette" â€” lurk before you leap\!
